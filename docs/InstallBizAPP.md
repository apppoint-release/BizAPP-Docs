4.  Replace {name} with "Product" for public customer release and "Dev" for dev release builds before running the below commands.

```
sc delete BizAPP-{name}-RegistryService
sc delete BizAPP-{name}-Bootstrap
sc delete BizAPP-{name}-HostingAgent
sc delete BizAPP-{name}-LicenseService
sc delete bizapp-{name}-backplane-1
sc delete bizapp-{name}-backplane-2
sc delete BizAPP-{name}-SessionStateManager
sc delete BizAPP-{name}-AutoUpdater

Administrator should provide user DB connection string that has to be added to it. 

1.	Open the local **SolutionConfigs** repository, if you have access to it. For Instance, E:\LocalSolutionConfigs
2.	Open the dev configs/<respective solution config file>, for instance, dev configs/Config_RecruitMgmt.xml in Notepad++.  
3.	Check if **Enterprise Name** and the **Database name** in the given connection string under **<respective_Solution_name>_UserDatabase>** is configured for you.
5.	Copy the path of the solution configuration file. For instance,E:\LocalSolutionConfigs\solutionconfigs\dev configs

3.	In the appsettings sections, add path to the license as 

```
<add key="licenseserver" value="13.71.71.190:13333" />
```

4. The service config file has to point to where your config file is stored as 

```
<add key="serviceconfigfile" value="E:\LocalSolutionConfigs\solutionconfigs\Config_Recruit.xml" />
```

5. Enable the trace logs and file logs to **true** to view and generate the error report.

```
<rules>
	<logger name="BizAPP*" minlevel="Debug" writeTo="tracelog" enabled="True" />
	<logger name="BizAPP*" minlevel="Debug" writeTo="filelog" enabled="false" />
</rules>
